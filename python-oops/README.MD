## Python

- Python support all type of programming paradigm.
- Python support functional programming, Object oriented programming, and procedure oriented programming.

# Oops introduction

- Oops ina programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.
- OOP helps to development faster and cheaper, with better software maintainability.
- OOPS uses the concept of objects and classes.
  A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. these can have their own attributes and methods.
- Simply, class is a design and object is real stuff.

### Object

- An object will have something that you can store data and an object will have some behaviour.
- If you want to store something in object, you need to declare variables.
- An object is an instance of a class.
- Every objects have certain attributes and every objects have certain behaviour.
- Everytime you create an object it is allocated to new space.
- Size of objects is depends on number of the variables.
- Constructor allocate size to object.

### Methods

- Functions in the object oriented programming called methods.

### How to create a class ?

- To create a class in python You can use `class` keyword, followed by the classname and colon.
- Inside the class, an `__init__` method has to be defined with `def`. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects.
- `__init__` method take one argument called `self`, which refers to object itself.
